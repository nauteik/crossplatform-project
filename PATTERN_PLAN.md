Builder Pattern Application Plan
Goal: To simplify the creation of complex PC configurations by allowing users to select components step-by-step.

1. Components:

Builder Interface: PCBuilder
Defines the steps to build a PC (e.g., add motherboard, add CPU, add GPU, add memory, add storage, add PSU, add case).
Concrete Builders: GamingPCBuilder, WorkstationPCBuilder, BudgetPCBuilder
Implement the PCBuilder interface to create specific types of PCs with predefined configurations.
Director: PCConfigurationManager
Orchestrates the building process using a PCBuilder. It takes a PCBuilder and calls the building steps in a specific order. This can also be used to validate the compatibility of components.
Product: PC
Represents the final PC configuration. It will have components like motherboard, CPU, GPU, memory, storage, PSU, and case.
2. Implementation Steps:

Define the PC class: This class will represent the final assembled PC. It will contain all the components.
Create the PCBuilder interface: This interface will define the methods for adding each component to the PC.
Implement Concrete Builders: Create concrete builder classes for different types of PCs (e.g., GamingPCBuilder, WorkstationPCBuilder, BudgetPCBuilder). Each builder will have its own implementation of the building steps, choosing appropriate components for the target PC type.
Create the PCConfigurationManager (Director): This class will take a PCBuilder and guide the construction process. It can also handle component compatibility checks.
Integrate with Frontend: The frontend will guide the user through the selection process, and the backend will use the builder to create the PC object.
3. Example Scenario:

A user wants to build a gaming PC.
The user selects components (CPU, GPU, Memory, etc.) through the frontend.
The backend uses the GamingPCBuilder to assemble the PC based on the user's selections.
The PCConfigurationManager validates the component compatibility.
The final PC object is created and can be added to the user's cart or saved for later.
Bridge Pattern Application Plan
Assessment: The existing Product, Brand, and ProductType classes might already be implicitly using the Bridge pattern if Product holds references to Brand and ProductType. However, to make it a more explicit and beneficial implementation, consider the following:

Goal: Decouple the Product abstraction from its concrete implementations of Brand and ProductType, allowing them to vary independently.

1. Components:

Abstraction: Product
Defines the high-level interface for a product.
Refined Abstraction: (Optional) ConfigurableProduct, StandardProduct
Extends the Product abstraction and adds more specific functionality. For example, ConfigurableProduct might have methods for adding/removing components.
Implementor Interface: ProductDetail
Defines the interface for concrete implementations of product details (e.g., Brand, ProductType).
Concrete Implementors: BrandDetail, ProductTypeDetail
Implement the ProductDetail interface, providing specific implementations for Brand and ProductType.
2. Implementation Steps:

Create the ProductDetail interface: This interface will define the common operations for product details like Brand and ProductType.
Implement Concrete Implementors: Create BrandDetail and ProductTypeDetail classes that implement the ProductDetail interface. These classes will encapsulate the specific details of Brand and ProductType respectively.
Modify the Product class:
Remove the direct references to Brand and ProductType.
Add a ProductDetail reference.
Provide methods to set and get the ProductDetail.
Refactor existing code: Update the code that uses Product to use the ProductDetail interface instead of directly accessing Brand and ProductType.
3. Example Scenario:

A Product needs to display its brand and type.
Instead of directly accessing the Brand and ProductType objects, it uses the ProductDetail interface to get the required information.
The ProductDetail can be either a BrandDetail or a ProductTypeDetail, allowing the Product to work with different types of product details without being tightly coupled to them.
By applying these patterns, you can create a more flexible and maintainable e-commerce platform that can easily adapt to changing requirements.
